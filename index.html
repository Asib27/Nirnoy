			<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p>False positive and false negative results are one of the prime reasons for wrong treatment in
				Bangladesh. This mainly occurs due to the lack of an accurate antibody test setup. Accurate test
				setups like Elisa ( Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay) are very costly, hence the majority of
				the population cannot afford them. So the aim of this project is to build a low cost Elisa reader
				which will be affordable by the entire population. The device works based on a local led diode
				light, sensor and an Arduino. For the proof of concept, several sample solutions of Curcumine in
				100% Acetic Acid were tested and the low cost ELISA reader could detect the changes in
				concentration of the solutions.</p>
